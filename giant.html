                <p>Today, I embarked on a challenging hiking adventure with my friends, and I must admit, the trail
                    exceeded all expectations. Initial online reviews that labeled it as difficult turned out to be a
                    strikingly accurate assessment, debunking my initial assumption of exaggeration. The trail's
                    predominant features seemed to be rugged rocks, and the scorching heat only added to the challenge.
                </p>

                <p>One of my friends, a seasoned hiker, effortlessly sprinted ahead, leaving my other friend and me to
                    navigate the demanding terrain at our own pace. The trail gradually grew more manageable with time,
                    and the breathtaking view that awaited us at the summit justified every drop of sweat shed. When we
                    finally took a well-deserved break, I found myself drenched and was grateful for the refreshing
                    respite. We thought we would be able to finish the hike in 4 hours as the duration written on the
                    website, but at the halfway point, it had taken us 3 hours instead of 2 due to how unprepared we
                    were.</p>

                <p>During our interlude, we enjoyed Pocky and madeleines, savoring the delightful contrast between the
                    treats and the demanding hike. As we sat looking below at the water, we contemplated our summer. We
                    were all stressed about college apps and pondered how we would feel a year from today. We discussed
                    our struggles with the SAT and how hard it was to write our personal essays. My friend who was going
                    to London explained the differences in her admissions process, which I found interesting as their
                    process was quite different from the CommonApp.</p>

                <p>The hike was hard, but in the end, I felt a sense of accomplishment from pulling myself through and
                    was happy to spend the day with my friends! There was also the pleasant surprise of not having any
                    mosquito bites, which I was glad for due to my mosquito allergy.</p>
