                <p>Recently, I rediscovered LunaDiary on my phone, a digital space I'd frequently used back in April to
                    gather my thoughts. It was perhaps the ethereal beauty of the moon a few nights ago that rekindled
                    my interest in the app. I wholeheartedly recommend giving it a try; its user interface is
                    aesthetically pleasing, and it offers a user-friendly experience.</p>
                <p>As I revisited some entries from April, I stumbled upon a reflection from the 7th of that month.
                    Among the lines, one thought particularly resonated with me: "While gazing at the moon, memories of
                    an old friend who had always been there for me during trying times flooded my mind, reminding me of
                    the profound beauty that our world holds."</p>
                <p>It's a beautiful reminder of the app's capacity to rekindle forgotten moments and stir contemplation.
                    LunaDiary, in its simplicity, becomes a gateway to introspection and appreciation, allowing you to
                    capture the essence of your experiences and emotions.</p>
                <p>The first two poems are about two of my old friends that I wrote about a long time ago. The last poem
                    is about how I miss that friend, which I wrote recently...</p>

                                    <b>Moon != you</b>
                                    <b>you != moon</b>
                        Pale, glowing, beautiful,
                        Jewel in the sky, far from my reach,
                        Lighting up the night, my cold path.
                        Hands numb, I stare in wonder,
                        Thinking of you, oh so similar to its beauty.

                        Tears bristling to flow in the frigid air,
                        Your cold gaze upon me, blank eyes,
                        Lips pursed into a thin line, full of contempt,
                        You look away, annoyed.

                        You like the Moon, so serene, so beautiful,
                        Yet does not remind me of the moon, my moon,
                        A flashlight in a power outage.
                        The Moon reminds me of you, an entity unapproachable,
                        Yet important to me.

                        
                                    <b>Perennial</b>
                        Nervous introductions, bleary eyes, and skepticism
                        I met the raccoon.
                        His extant a circle, a rectangle
                        No, 3 rectangles, parallel, an illusion.
                        A chameleon without a sense of duplicity
                        Green, red, yellow,
                        Always in 2 places, never one, never.

                        Soft spoken, voice choppy, sleepiness oozes- form red and yellow, he sits.
                        Twiddling nervously, I panic.
                        Turning the typewriter,
                        The keys click, a broken melody.
                        Papers fly, America West, America East, Korea, Canada.
                        Pages Swirl- I choose America East.
                        Placeholder full, the machine dings green,
                        I sigh, relieved.

                        Birds set upon the island, now sunrise.
                        His Sun has set, voice sprightly,
                        Perhaps nocturnal- he speaks.
                        Ears strained, mind discombobulated, a fray of words and numbers attack me.
                        Patient, he repeats, ever so euphonious and transient, but helpful nevertheless.
                        
                        New pages come and go, keys rip apart, he stays.
                        An anomaly, a gift, a mystery, a shapeshifter.
                        Chest full of curiosity, longing, I cut apart the typewriter.
                        His true form a mystery, the magic gone, only a single paper remains intact.
                        Tears fall, my companion gone, the ink blotches,
                        Years pass as I hold onto the words, “One day”
                    </pre>
                <pre>
                                <b>New Poem</b>
                        You say you're not the sun, the shining light that everyone likes, loves, and adores, 
                        but to me you're my favorite light, calm and wise.

                        I like you the light that won't burn me if I stand too close, the light I can stare at forever.
                        The light that keeps me company in the dark, reassuring me that I'm not alone.

                        The light that shines unlike the rest, able to see past my walls of complex thought.
                        You're my moon, a constant that I look for every fortnight.

                        Beautiful, the only thing I see in the vast darkness,
                        stars nothing but a speck of dust in comparison to your beauty.
                    </pre>
