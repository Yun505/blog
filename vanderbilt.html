                        In the wake of a whirlwind month filled with college applications, the flurry of Valentine's Day, and the demands of trimester exams, my friends and I decided it was high time for a stress-relief escape to the city. Early in the morning, we hopped on a bus and made our way to the bustling heart of it all: Times Square.</p>
                    <p>Our first stop was <a href="https://www.awesumdimsum.us/" class="highlight">AweSum DimSum</a>, a place we'd heard raving reviews about, to indulge in their famous circular croissants that had recently taken the internet by storm. The dim sum was nothing short of remarkable, especially when you consider the value. We walked away from the table with contented stomachs and spent less than 20 dollars for a hearty meal. I was particularly pleased with the kiosk options in the shop and their extensive range of vegetarian choices, which perfectly catered to my friend's preferences.</p>
                    <p>With our cravings satisfied, we set off for Vanderbilt Summit, where the views from above were absolutely breathtaking. However, as we ascended to the upper floors, we were greeted by an abundance of sunshine and the feeling of being immersed in the midst of summer. We couldn't resist capturing the moment with countless photographs and had a blast in the silver ball room, playfully tossing balloons back and forth.</p>
                    <p>After our adventure at Vanderbilt Summit, we made a pit stop at Starbucks to quench our thirst with some complimentary water and proceeded to Rockefeller Center. Here, we marveled at the nearby cathedral and observed the graceful skaters below.</p>
                    <p>Our journey then led us to Bryant Park, where the New York Public Library stood as a magnificent backdrop. We leisurely strolled through the park and admired the architecture as we headed back to our bus stop in the vibrant heart of Times Square.</p>
                    <p>While we waited for the bus we indulged in some cute sweets from a nearby bakery and also the famed circle croissants which were moist and very sweet.</p>
                    <p>Our day of exploration and shared experiences in the city served as the perfect remedy to the academic and emotional demands we'd faced recently, leaving us with a treasure trove of memories to cherish.</p>
