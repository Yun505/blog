                    <p>I picked up this book because of how much I loved Murakami's writing style. It was clear, easy to
                        read and I could feel the raw emotions that the author was trying to deliver without the usage
                        of flowery language.</p>
                    <p>In class we read one of his short stories and it reminded me of retro film, I felt nostalgic and
                        sad despite the story having nothing of such content.</p>
                    <p>I was hesitant at first to pick up Norwegian Wood; however, as it had been a book I heard was
                        deeply sad.</p>
                    <p>After finishing the book, I do not regret picking it up; however, I am sad that even if I
                        were to read it again, I don't think I would experience the same sadness I had felt as I read
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Murakami's writing has a way of allowing the reader to see the sadness of life in a way that
                        doesn't feel forced, but natural and feel a sense of wonder. It's not like a normal story where
                        everything feels as intended, but adds some extra details that aren't necessary to the prompt,
                        making it feel like a story someone would tell me in real life.</p>

                    <p>The image depicts me running toward the lightsâ€”a symbolic action I hope the protagonist undertakes later. The open ending left me assuming that he was unable to find complete peace with Naoko. This action, running towards the lights, embodies my wish for resolution of the day like that of the character's emotions on the matter of Naoko's death.</p>
