                <p>During Thanksgiving break, my friend reached out to me to hang out, which delighted me as I hadn't
                    seen
                    them since the summer break in Korea. I was curious about how they were doing, and it was fun to
                    call
                    and organize our plans for what to do in the city. We decided to go on a food run together as we
                    both
                    enjoy food. Planning was smooth sailing as he was very good at organizing and suggested cool places
                    in
                    the city that I had never heard of before. Usually, I'm the planner, so it was nice to have someone
                    help
                    me out and plan together.</p>

                <p>We decided to do a Chinatown visit, explore a holiday market, and embark on a small eats crawl. In
                    today's blog, I'll focus more on the foods in Chinatown and one brunch place, taking my time to talk
                    about the other foods and adding pictures later. I'm currently transitioning my blog from my old
                    website, which isn't up anymore. I'll be adding sliders for other foods later so you can see the
                    pictures and hopefully visit them yourself!</p>

                <p>Now, onto the main story. I discovered the express bus in my hometown, which was only about a
                    15-minute
                    walk from my house but would take me into the city 40 minutes faster than the bus right in front of
                    my
                    house. This was a cool discovery, and we got to the city relatively quickly, allowing us to
                    immediately
                    head to a famous brunch restaurant: Davelle. I had been wanting to go there for years; it was saved
                    on
                    my Instagram reels and Google Maps, but for some reason, the timing was never right. I was very
                    excited
                    to try their acclaimed toasts, which were as delicious and filling as they looked in the picture
                    above.
                    The ambiance of the restaurant was quite nice, and I especially enjoyed the light music in the
                    background. My friend ordered the checkered toast (sesame and vanilla), while I got the Yuzu toast.
                    We
                    shared half of each toast, and it made for a scrumptious breakfast.</p>

                <p>Later, we headed to Koneko, a very cute cat cafe, which was close to our location. We didn't play
                    with
                    the cats as it cost $25 an hour, and we wanted to save money for food, but we watched them from
                    across
                    the glass. I couldn't help but say "awwww" whenever they moved; they were absolutely adorable.
                    Afterward, we went to Mei Lah Wah and Golden Steamer in Chinatown for their steamed dumplings and
                    pineapple bread. Both were absolutely delicious, and I am excited to visit again sometime during
                    Winter
                    break!</p>
